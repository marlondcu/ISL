Directory's structure

Videos are stored in different folders, one for each person, consisting of Person1, Person2, Person3, Person4, Person5 and Person6. Inside each folder there are 78 files being 3 for each alphabet letter. File name is given by letter followed by 1, 2 or 3 between brackets. This number represents the shot. For example: "a (1).mov" means shape "a" first shot. 

Frames are stored into different zip files, one for each person. The file name structure is "Person" + person's number + shape + shot number + frame number, separated by hyphen (-). For example, "Person1-A-1-1.jpg" refers to Person 1, shape A, first shot, first frame.
